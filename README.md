# Proof's Cafe
This is a website created for a bakery concept for my wife and me.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

This website was created using only HTML and CSS. I wanted to perfect positioning of elements as well as implementing media queries into my webpages for different viewport sizes. This site was made using floats instead of the standard flex-box that so many modern sites use. This is critical in really hammering down the box model.
## Optimizations

I would like to go back and fix some of the spots that don't work together flawlessly when the viewport changes size. It's not very noticeable, but you can see spots where the background shows through. This is due to using the floated elements and absolute measurements on certain photos/elements. 
## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about the way that elements work together to hold a webpage orientation together. I think that this was a good exercise for precisely that. In reality, nobody wants to use floats, but that is precisely why I did it. Most of the current websites have lost the knowledge of how everything actually clicks together. I aim to learn more deeply and understand the fundamentals that brought us to flexbox.
